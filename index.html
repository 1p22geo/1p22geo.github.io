              Still in development, but actually the most ambitious so far. A
              simple Facebook clone with Wordpress-like features. Supports
              Markdown, KaTeX and images. Made using Next.js 14, Typescript,
              Tailwind CSS, React, MongoDB and OpenTelemetry. The whole app is
              contained in Docker. There are also unit tests with Jest and
              end-to-end tests with Playwright. All CI/CD (with all tests and
              Docker image building) runs on my local Jenkins instance.

              at Null Crypto no transactions get commited anywhere except
              <code>window.localStorage</code>. You can trade a couple crypto

              lot of RAM and CPU, and it's still not optimised for GPU's. But at

          React is simple, intuitive, and react hooks make development a lot
          easier (especially the new use hook), but I'm still not fully
          satisfied with my knowledge of <code>&lt;Suspense/&gt;</code> and

          In my humble opinion, Typescript is just the perfect language.
          Compiles to JS, which runs on web, desktop (node.js) and even mobile
          (React Native). It's high level enough to be fully cross-platform, and
          the npm library ecosystem makes every task as easy as

          Python, with its many libraries is a very powerful language, but
          sometimes a library just doesn't work on some OS, and nobody knows
          why. The pip ecosystem is large for one thing, but resolving

          Docker makes everything cross-platform, as long as you can make Docker
          work there. While I'm pretty comfortable with the basic usage
          (building images, Dockerfile, docker compose), more advanced features
          like Docker swarm still scare me out.
